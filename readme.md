# AuthKit API

## Description

AuthKit API is a robust and modular authentication template built with Spring Boot. It provides a complete foundation for secure user authentication and authorization, ideal for starting new projects with ready-to-use authentication features.

This project includes support for JWT (access and refresh tokens), password reset flows, and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP.

## Main Features

-   User registration and login
-   JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens
-   Secure password reset via email (token-based)
-   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
-   Session management and token refresh
-   Centralized error handling with custom messages

## Technologies

-   Java 21
-   Spring Boot
-   Spring Web
-   Spring Security
-   Spring Data JPA
-   MySQL
-   JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   2FA TOTP

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mwndl/authkit-api.git

    ```

4. The API will be available at:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
